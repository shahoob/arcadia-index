Movie name : Pimp My Ride - S01E10 - Shondas Mustang Convertible
Description : Shanda''s 1989 Mustang convertible gives new meaning to the term \"rag top.\" This ride is so busted, there''s a gaping hole in the ceiling. there''s also trouble for backseat passengers, one window is missing and the other won''t roll down. And forget about listening to the radio, turning on the heat, or the air conditioning, ''cause none of this stuff works.
